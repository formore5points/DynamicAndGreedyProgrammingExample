Dynamic and Greedy Programming solution on a Football Player Selection Problem

Note: Greedy part is working correctly but I can not say the same thing for dynamic approach :)

# Explanation of the Expected Quality Player Selection

Suppose that you are the manager of a football club. You are expected to sign free contract 
players for your team with the given budget of $X. The owner of the club will fire you if you 
spend money more than $X (You are allowed to spend less than $X). You are considering N 
different positions (such as Goalkeeper, Defender, Forward etc.). For each position in a team, 
there are K players who are available to play that specific position. However, you must sign at 
most one player for each position. If you do not sign any players at a particular position, then 
you plan to stick with the players you already have for that position.

Each player has three main information:
The player’s position,
The amount of money that will cost to sign the player,
The player’s rating.
The goal is to maximize the total ratings of players you signed while spending no more than 
$X.

Operations:
To maximize total ratings without spending more than $X.
